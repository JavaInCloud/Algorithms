Creating and Destroying Objects 

  Consider static factory methods instead of constructors
         Unlike constructors, they have names
         They are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked
         They can return an object of any subtype of their return type
         They reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances
